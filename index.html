          <h2>Charles Bridge</h2>
          <p>This now very famous path along the former royal route used to carry kings along their coronation procession from Old Town to the Prague Castle. <br><br>
          The bridge is lined with thirty statues of saints, including the martyred St John of Nepomuk; based on various legends promising good luck, visitors have rubbed the plaques at the base of his star-crowned likeness until the engraved woman and dog gleam gold.</p>

          <h23>Prague Astronomical Clock</h2>
          <p>An icon of the Czech Republic, a national cultural heritage asset, a symbol of Prague's history and the oldest institution of Czech self-government. At the end of World War II, its underground served as the centre of the Prague Uprising against Nazism and the town hall was almost destroyed by shelling. Not even the bell from 1313 survived, and the altar of the Chapel of the Virgin Mary was also severely damaged. However, the people of Prague repaired their national treasure and today you too can enjoy the Old Town Astronomical Clock with the procession of the twelve apostles, the majesty of the state rooms, the tenderness of the Chapel of the Virgin Mary and the mysterious Romanesque-Gothic underground.

          <h3>A tropical garden within the castle</h3>
          <p>In the 16th century, Emperor Rudolf II introduced tropical and citrus plants to Prague Castle. Today, this tradition thrives in the Orangery, a modern greenhouse established within the Royal Gardens in 1999. You can explore this lush haven during the summer season.
          <br><br>
          You can also explore other stunning Prague Castle gardens like the Royal Garden, the Garden on the Bastion, and the Southern Gardens, offering serene escapes amidst Prague's hustle and bustle.</p>

            <br><br>
            It comes without a surprise, that you will find a museum in Prague dedicated to his life and some statues scattered around the city. </p>
